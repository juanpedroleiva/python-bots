<h1>Insta Unfollowers</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This Python was built using [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/), for use with Instagram, for educational purposes only.
Insta Unfollowers requires minimal configuration for setting up and running, only username and password is required.
After installing requirements.txt simply replace the username and pw variables for your own real instagram credentials and run.
The code will login to Instagram and will compare the users you follow with the users that follow you and return a list of
users that don't follow you back. Simple as that.
